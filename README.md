Problem

-The goal is to build an elevator system that accepts requests from users on different floors. The elevator should respond to requests by picking up passengers at their source floor and taking them to their destination floor, while considering intermediate stops.

-I assumed that the building starts on level 1.

-I have allowed for the user to determine how tall the building is.

-I have created the Elevator Simulation to run with a set of perameters of a source floor and a destination floor so that you can test with different combinations
